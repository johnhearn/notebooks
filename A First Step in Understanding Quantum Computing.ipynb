    "## A First Step in Understanding Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the enigmas of quantum mechanics is its element of chance and probability. Quantum computers can use that fact to generate better random numbers. It also serves as a very first baby step in quantum computing in general!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example showing how to simulate a quantum random number generator *from scratch* in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language. Of cource you need a real quantum computer to *do* quantum computing so the objective here is just to understand how it works with simple code. For that reason this doesn't use a library for quantum computing, or any library for that matter, but rather aims to be the simplest possible tutorial on quantum computing concepts for people with some programming experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "No knowledge of quantum computing is assumed and the maths is at a minimum but not zero. You do need to understand a little bit of matrix multiplication and what a complex number is (although that'll be later and mostly hidden). The Julia syntax is very clean and will be easy to follow for most programmers. I admit that the unicode variable names are a bit experimental but I hope that they help get the message across.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a popular science explanation and we'll get into some actual code which simulates what an actual quantum computer does. Let's get started."

    "One thing we could do is to flip its value with a NOT gate. We can do the same thing with our arrows by multiplying them by a 2x2 matrix (this is where the linear algebra comes in). We define the [quantum NOT gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Pauli-X_gate) (also called an X-gate) as a matrix multiplication like this and check that it does indeed flip our qubits."
