    "The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem states that applying the function $$ f(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array} & \\frac{x}{2} & x \\text{ even} \\\\ \\frac{3x + 1}{2} & x \\text{ odd} & \\end{array} \\right.$$ to any $x \\in Z^{+}$ will, after repeated aplication, eventually converge to 1. Assuming the conjecture to be true we can create a novel binary numbering system. \n",

    "First let's look at the base-2 number system. Take any number and apply the following function: $$ f(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array} & \\frac{x}{2} & x \\text{ even} \\\\ \\frac{x - 1}{2} & x \\text{ odd} & \\end{array} \\right.$$ \n",

    "If every time we land on an even number we encode it as $0$ and every time we land on an odd number (greater than 1) then we encode it as $1$ then it can be seen that the sequence of $0$s and $1$s generate a string representing the base-2 binary encoding of the original value, in reverse order. For example take the number 5: 5 is odd so encode a $1$, apply $f(x)$ to obtain 2 $\\to$ 2 is even so read off $0$ and apply $f(x)$ to obtain 1 $\\to$ 1 is final value and odd so read off $1$ and stop. We have generated the string $101_{2}$ which is indeed the binary representation of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works by reading off a $1$ or a $0$, shifting and repeating. All values will eventually end at 1 when the most significant digit has been reached. The following function shows the procedure."
